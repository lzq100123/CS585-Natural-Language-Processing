Result evaluation:

The result is generated according to the four relationship between words in the chain and words which are going to add into the chain.
The four relationship are synonym, antonym, hpernym and hyponym. We add a word to a chain if any one of these four relationships are satisfied.
New chain will be created if there is no relationship satisfied or no synset for a word.

There are some example result:
Chain 3: beliefs(1), belief(1), view(1), suspicion(1), faith(1) 
Chain 84: life(3), time(2), survival(1), period(1), days(2), lifetime(1), energy(1) 

We can see words related to each other would be added into one lexical chain

Enhancement:

1. we could add more relationships to increase lexical chain length
2. we could create chain with different synset to increase the corelation between two words
