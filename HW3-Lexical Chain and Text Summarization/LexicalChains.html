<H1>Programming  Assignment: Lexical Chains</H1>
<P>
<HR>

You are to write a program that takes a text file as input and outputs
the set of lexical chains in the text, using the method discussed in
class (refer to the slides).  Use single words and don't worry about
extracting nouns that are phrases (such as "White House" or "lexical
chain").  Download Wordnet and (optional) a library for accessing it
from Java, Ruby, or Python.  (If you find and use another Wordnet
library, just document it.)

<P>
Do this project individually or in pairs (see below for extra assignment for pair projects.
<p>
<ol>
  <li> Create lexical chains based on the lexical relationships of
  synonymy, antonymy, and one level of hyper/hyponymy.  In other
  words, if a noun is related by one of these relationships to an
  existing lexical chain, it should be added to it, otherwise it
  should start a new chain.<P>
  Output should be in the form:
  <pre>
Chain 1: girl(2), woman(1), women(3), person(1), she(4)
Chain 2: hat(2), skirt(1), pants(2), clothes(1), shirt(2)
...
</pre>
  Each chain lists the words it contains, with the number of word
  occurrences in parentheses.
  <li> Evaluate the results (qualitatively) and comment on how they
  might be improved. 
  <li> (For pairs) Implement one of the following enhancements:
  <ol>
    <li> Use more lexical relationships, including sibling
    hypo/hypernymy and meronym relationships.
    <li> Only allow a noun to enter a lexical chain if it is within a
    threshold number of words (this should be a parameter) to the
    closest element of the chain.
    <li> As you add elements to a chain, restrict the senses (synsets)
    of the nouns in the chain to those consistent with all nouns in
    the chain (i.e., just those senses related by the given lexical
    relations).
    <li> Find and use phrasal nouns, not just single words.  You can
    do this by finding short sequences of words that have their own
    entries in Wordnet.
  </ol>
 Evaluate the results of your enhanced system, and compare them
  to the previous system.
  <li> Extra credit: Use the lexical chains to automatically create a
  summary of the input article.
